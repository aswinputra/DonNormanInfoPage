			<h2 id="name">Don A. Norman</h2>
			<p id="content">Donald Arthur Norman is the director of The Design Lab at University of California, San Diego.<br/><br/>

He is best known for his books on design, especially "The Design of Everyday Things". He is widely regarded for his expertise in the fields of design, usability engineering, and cognitive science. Norman was also part of a select team flown in to investigate the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. He is also a co-founder and consultant with the Nielsen Norman Group.(Wikipedia, n.d)<br/><br/>

Much of his work involves the advocacy of user-centered design. His books all have the underlying purpose of furthering the field of design, from doors to computers. Norman has taken a controversial stance in saying that the design research community has had little impact in the innovation of products, and that while academics can help in refining existing products, it is technologists that accomplish the breakthroughs. To this end, Norman named his website with the initialism JND to signify his endeavors to make a difference.(Wikipedia, n.d)<br/><br/>

			<h2 id="book-title">The Design of Everyday Things</h2>
			<p id="content">This book is one of the best selling book by Donald A.Norman whos is a cognitive scientist and usability engineer. This book explains about how design is a way of communicating between user and the object. This book was published in 1988 with the title of <span id="italic-title">"The Psychology of Everyday Things"</span> and was later changed to <span id="italic-title">"The Design of Everyday Things"</span>

<br/><br/>In this book, he mentions a number of design principles. One of the most important design principles that he mentions is Affordance. Through this book, Norman introduces the term <b>perceived affordance</b> which defines action posibilities that are perceivable or recognise by the user/actor. Section below will show the descriptions of the affordance, perceivable affordance and signifiers mentioned by Norman

			<h2 id="affordance">Affordance</h2>
			<p id="content">The term affordance used by Norman was taken from J.J Gibson's book; <span id="italic-title">"The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems"</span>. Affordance is a relationship between an object and its user. This relationship determine how the object is used by the user. For example, a cup affords something that can contain a liquid and the cup handle affords the user to slip their finger into it which then affords holding and carrying. An affordance only exist when the users see it.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			An Example of an affordance taken from his book is a door plate which affords pushing because there are no handles to pull and a door knob which affords pulling.
			</p>
			<div class="example">
				<div class="door-back1">
					<div class="door-pull"></div>
				</div>
				<div class="door-back">
					<div class="door-push"></div>
				</div>

			<p id="content">Unlike the affordance that was explained by J.J Gibson, Norman came up with his own definition of affordance which is <b>perceived affordance</b>. A perceived affordance is a concept of affordance that depend on the user's status such as their goals, history, and experience. Perceived affordance predict the possibility of a user to interact with the object based on the past experience of the user. As an example, the video below will show the example of affordance.

			<h2 id="signifier">Signifier</h2>
			<p id="content">Another good example cited from Norman's book is a glass. Where glass affords transparency and at the same time it's physical structure also blocks the passage of physical objects. Therefore, glass affords transparency and support. Even though a glass is a good example of an affordance however, it may also causes confusion between user. Transparency of a glass has benefited people however, many people has injured themself walking or running towards a glass. There are some affordance that cannot be perceived therefore, signifiers can be used to give people a hint of an object interaction. A signifier can be intentional and deliberate.
