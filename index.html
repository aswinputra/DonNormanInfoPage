			<h2 id="name">Don A. Norman</h2>
			<p id="content">Donald Arthur Norman is the director of The Design Lab at University of California, San Diego.<br/><br/>

He is best known for his books on design, especially "The Design of Everyday Things". He is widely regarded for his expertise in the fields of design, usability engineering, and cognitive science. Norman was also part of a select team flown in to investigate the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. He is also a co-founder and consultant with the Nielsen Norman Group.(Wikipedia, n.d)<br/><br/>

Much of his work involves the advocacy of user-centered design. His books all have the underlying purpose of furthering the field of design, from doors to computers. Norman has taken a controversial stance in saying that the design research community has had little impact in the innovation of products, and that while academics can help in refining existing products, it is technologists that accomplish the breakthroughs. To this end, Norman named his website with the initialism JND to signify his endeavors to make a difference.(Wikipedia, n.d)<br/><br/>

			<h2 id="affordance">Affordance</h2>
			<p id="content">The term affordance used by Norman was taken from J.J Gibson's book; <span name="italic-title">"The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems"</span>. Affordance is a relationship between an object and its user. This relationship determine how the object is used by the user. For example, a cup affords something that can contain a liquid and the cup handle affords the user to slip their finger into it which then affords holding and carrying. An affordance only exist when the user sees it.</p>
